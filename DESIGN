Description: 
Single-player Blackjack in the terminal. As in any other blackjack game, there is a dealer (artificial intelligence) and at least one player. This blackjack game will play by standard blackjack rules. Dealer stands on 17.

User Experience: 
make, ./server and ./client to play
Text-based cards in the format [VALUE][SUIT], user can choose to hit or stand with the (0) or (1) keys. Theserver prompts the client and sends the current player/dealer hands to the client. 	

Technical Design:
	Topics Used:
		Networking/servers
		Structs/Nodes+Linked Lists
		Memory Allocation
		User input
		Signals
	Breakdown (what it was supposed to be):
		M: 
			User input for blackjack
			Server side of network
		K: 
			User + dealer integration
			Visualization of cards with ANSI black magic
			Client side of network
		S: 
			Dealer AI
			Bit of both server and client
	Nervous Breakdown (what happened):
		M: 
			Server/client
			Networking
		K: 
			Fixing S's numerous seg faults
			Server/client
		S: 
			Game mechanics but with a lot of seg faults and problems
			Abandoning ship (;-;)
	Data Structures:
		Card struct will store the number/suit as a string and the value as an int, and a reference to the next card in the hand
     	       	Linked list to hold cards
		Array holds all of the hands
	Algorithms:
		Randomizing for shuffling cards

Timeline (original):
01-11-2016: Complete single player BlackJack (no networking)
01-16-2016: Set up networking
01-19-2016: Integrate BlackJack into the networking
